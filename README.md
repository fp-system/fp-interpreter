## FP - Functional Programming

The separation of functions into pure functions and into side effects works, 
but only a script language has emerged from it. 
FP is a strict form, point-free and with combinators as suggested by John Backus. 
This FP was equipped with infix notation and OOP, but only with immutable data structures, 
which is a bit inefficient on the whole. The side effects also only work with an order 
via the "monad" and sometimes with algebraic effects within the "monad".
Functional programming is not the ultra one would want. Programming languages will always 
remain problem-oriented. But in addition to these honestly stated disadvantages, 
it also offers advantages, such as the "[Algebra of Programming](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punktfreie_Programmiersprache)", 
which is made possible by the referential transparency of this implementation.
